      <h2>AN INTRODUCTION TO BEADS AND BEADING</h2>
      <h5>Title description, December 16, 2018</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg1" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>Some text..</p>
    <p> Beads are small objects of decoration that are usually used in jewelry. In order to be used beads must usually first be pierced so that thread can be passed through them so that they can be joined together on a string. However beads can also be adhered to surfaces of various items such as wall hangings and sculptures in which case they would not need to be pierced. Beads can also be used to adorn personal items such as handbags and purses. They can also be found in household items such as cushions and table cloths. Beads differ vastly in size from tiny little beads that are too small to handle without precision tools to large beads that are more than a centimeter in diameter.</p>
	<p>Please don’t get confused by the term “seed bead”. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the bead is made from seeds, which some beads are. “Seed bead” is a generic term that is often applied to any small bead.
	Beads can be made from all kinds of different material, but glass, plastic and stone tend to be the most common. However beads are also made from many other materials including bone, horn, shell, ivory, coral, pearl, metal, gemstones, polymer clay, metal clay, resin, wood, ceramic, fiber, paper, seeds and synthetic materials. As you can see you are spoilt for choice when it comes to deciding what materials you would like to work with.
	Beads have been around a very along time since the first known civilizations. The oldest known examples of jewelry are an approximately 100,000 year old pair of beads made from sea snail shells. Apart from being used in jewelry and personal adornment beads are also used for religious purposes, good luck talismans and curative agents.</p>
	<p>The craft of making things out of beads is called beadwork. There are many different beadwork techniques and they can be broadly categorized as stringing, embroidery, crochet, knitting, loom weaving and off-loom weaving.
	Hobbyists of all abilities can practise the craft of beadworking. The simplest examples of beaded jewelry can be created by a novice beader in virtually no time at all. Experienced beaders may spend weeks of meticulous effort on their beadwork using specialized equipment and tools.
